## Project Structure

This repository contains three main components:

-   `hotelmore/`: The Spring Boot backend application, providing RESTful APIs for data management.
-   `hotel-more/`: The React.js frontend application, consuming the backend APIs to provide the user interface.
-   `images/`: A directory for static image assets used across the project (e.g., logo, sample room photos).
